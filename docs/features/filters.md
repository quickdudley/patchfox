# Abuse Prevention using Patchfox

Patchfox has many features to enable users to self-moderate their Scuttlebutt experience. These tools will not affect gossiping or data storage; they will only act on displaying data.

## Filters

The tool is _filters_. Users can create a custom filter that targets a feed, a channel, or a set of keywords. Any combination is valid, and if they match a given message then the action is triggered. There are two options for filter actions: **Hiding the message** and **Blurring images**.

You can also set an expiration date for a filter. For example, if someone you like is talking about a current event that you do not want to hear about, you can filter that user temporarily for a couple days. After the time range expires, you'll see their posts again. Keep in mind that you will also see the past posts.

The above gif demonstrates the filter UX.

Filters are saved locally in your Patchfox configuration. They are not broadcast publicly to the SSB network.
