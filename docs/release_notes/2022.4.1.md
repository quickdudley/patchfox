# Release 2022.4.1

## New

* New menu items to compose _posts_ and _blogs_ using the sidebar.
* New package to display a _Buy Me a Coffee_ menu item under help. This part of my effort to move supporters from OC to Ko-Fi.

## Changes

* Patchfox will attempt to load `votes` automatically now. It used to require a click on _(get votes)_. That was done because it is very costly to do multiple concurrent MUXRPC calls over WS. Let's see if it works better now.
* Added Ko-Fi links to website, and readme.

## Fixes

* Fixed: removing identities.
* Fixed: Can't load Zine mini app.
* Fixed: Open _sidebar_ action now uses a sidebar icon instead of a _left arrow_.
* Fixed: Problem getting description of a profile.
* Fixed: `AvatarChip` problem when `ssb.avatar()` returned no info.
* Fixed: The `voteCounter` component dropdown now renders correctly.
