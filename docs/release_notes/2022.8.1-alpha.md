# Release 2022.8.1-alpha

This is a complete rework of Patchfox. I've outlined the challenges and decisions regarding the future of Patchfox in [Patchfox reborn as a desktop app](https://andregarzia.com/2022/05/Patchfox-reborn-as-a-desktop-app.html). 

Patchfox is now an Electron-based application. What you're using now is an alpha quality release.

## Changes

oh boy...

## I SAID CHANGES

Okay, besides the whole _Patchfox is now a desktop app_ change, I've replaced all Svelte-based code with [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org)-based code. That means that Patchfox no longer requires a build system to transpile its source code into something a browser can understand. This makes development a lot faster and also makes it easier to reason about the code.
