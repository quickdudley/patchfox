# Release 2022.8.1-alpha

This is a complete rework of Patchfox. I've outlined the challenges and decisions regarding the future of Patchfox in [Patchfox reborn as a desktop app](https://andregarzia.com/2022/05/Patchfox-reborn-as-a-desktop-app.html). 

Patchfox is now an Electron-based application. What you're using now is an alpha quality release.

# WARNING

This is an alpha version of Patchfox. At the moment it can only load the default
identity in your \`.ssb\` folder. Support for multiple identities and multiple
backends will be reinstated soon.

This version uses `db1`, it is not compatible with existing `db2` installations such as Manyverse and Perihelion.

Patchfox will use your current installed identity. If you're using Patchwork, you need to quit Patchwork before running Patchfox. 

Patchfox will reindex the database if needed. This process might take a while (there is a dialog showing the progress). If you switch back from Patchfox to Patchwork, Patchwork will reindex the database to its taste.

## Changes

oh boy...

## I SAID CHANGES

Okay, besides the whole _Patchfox is now a desktop app_ change, I've replaced all Svelte-based code with [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org)-based code. That means that Patchfox no longer requires a build system to transpile its source code into something a browser can understand. This makes development a lot faster and also makes it easier to reason about the code.
