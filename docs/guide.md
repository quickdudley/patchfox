# Getting Started

## What is Secure Scuttlebutt

Secure Scuttlebutt is an offline-first decentralized peer-to-peer network in which people can share data with each other and their friends forming a social graph similar to how friendship and gossip work in the physical world. Even though this is a correct way of explaining it, it doesn't really help you understand what it is, does it? The best explanation is the video found on the main page of [https://scuttlebutt.nz](https://scuttlebutt.nz) which is linked below:

## How does Patchfox fit into it

There are many applications you can use to access Secure Scuttlebutt (we call them clients). You may be familiar with the two most popular ones [Patchwork](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork) and [Manyverse](https://manyver.se). There are many other clients available besides these two. Patchfox is another client.

## How to configure it

Patchfox will use your default SSB data folder if available (the `.ssb` folder inside your home folder). If this is your first time using SSB, Patchfox will create that folder for you and place new keys inside.
