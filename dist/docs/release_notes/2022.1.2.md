# Release 2022.1.1

## Rework

A huge part of this release is the invisible work of [refactoring the high-level SSB library](https://github.com/soapdog/patchfox/issues/105) used in Patchfox into multiple high-level SSB libraries to better [support multiple SSB server implementations](https://github.com/soapdog/patchfox/issues/109). This has been a ton of work, and it is all under the surface.

A visible feature that is enabled by this work is supporting multiple identities, a video showing this feature [is available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNIXQH1fX_A).

## Fixes & Improvements

* New preferences to set font size for both viewing content and composing new messages.
* Adding thumbnails to blog messages in the blog compose window works again.
* Fixes wrong message in `errorHandler` package when the error originates outside a package.
* Fixed bug in the _popular query_ used to compute the _hub &rarr; popular_ view. It was barfing errors if a message was missing.
* Fixed a wrong menu entry in the `settings` package.
* Fixed problem with thumbnail attachment in `blog` composition.
